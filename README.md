# Case study: Combination Industries

 I considered it necessary to analyze the existing website. For this, I performed the desktop and mobile navigation to obtain the user's perspective, and after having the user's perspective, I performed tests on the Google PageSpeed Insights tool. I concluded that the original website and contents are well designed. But I had improvements to be explored to improve the usability and increase conversion rates and exceed user expectations., just applying the concepts of UX / UI.
